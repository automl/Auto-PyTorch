Manual
======

This manual shows how to get started with Auto-PyTorch. We recommend going over the examples first.
There are additional recommendations on how to interact with the API, further below in this manual.
However, you are welcome to contribute to this documentation by making a Pull-Request.

The searching starts by calling `search()` function of each supported task.
Currently, we are supporting Tabular classification and Tabular Regression.
We expand the support to image processing tasks in the future.

Examples
========
* `Classification <examples/20_basics/example_tabular_classification.html>`_
* `Regression <examples/20_basics/example_tabular_regression.html>`_
* `Customizing the search space <examples/40_advanced/example_custom_configuration_space.html>`_
* `Changing the resampling strategy <examples/40_advanced/example_resampling_strategy.html>`_
* `Visualizing the results <examples/40_advanced/example_visualization.html>`_

Resource Allocation
===================

Auto-PyTorch allows to control the maximum allowed resident set size memory (RSS) that an estimator can use. By providing the `memory_limit` argument to the `search()` method, one can make sure that neither the individual machine learning models fitted by SMAC nor the final ensemble consume more than `memory_limit` megabytes.

Additionally, one can control the allocated time to search for a model via the argument `total_walltime_limit` to the `search()` method. This argument controls the total time SMAC can use to search for new configurations. The more time is allocated, the better the final estimator will be.

Ensemble Building Process
=========================

Auto-PyTorch uses ensemble selection by `Caruana et al. (2004) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1015330.1015432>`_
to build an ensemble based on the modelsâ€™ prediction for the validation set. The following hyperparameters control how the ensemble is constructed:

* ``ensemble_size`` determines the maximal size of the ensemble. If it is set to zero, no ensemble will be constructed.
* ``ensemble_nbest`` allows the user to directly specify the number of models considered for the ensemble.  When an integer is provided for this hyperparameter, the final ensemble chooses each predictor from only the best n models. If a float between 0.0 and 1.0 is provided, ``ensemble_nbest`` would be interpreted as a fraction suggesting the percentage of models to use in the ensemble building process (namely, if ensemble_nbest is a float, library pruning is implemented as described in `Caruana et al. (2006) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2006.76>`_). For example, if 10 candidates are available for the ensemble building process and the hyper-parameter is `ensemble_nbest==0.7``, we build an ensemble by taking the best 7 models among the original 10 candidate models.
* ``max_models_on_disc`` defines the maximum number of models that are kept on the disc, as a mechanism to control the amount of disc space consumed by Auto-PyTorch. Throughout the automl process, different individual models are optimized, and their predictions (and other metadata) are stored on disc. The user can set the upper bound on how many models are acceptable to keep on disc, yet this variable takes priority in the definition of the number of models used by the ensemble builder (that is, the minimum of ``ensemble_size``, ``ensemble_nbest`` and ``max_models_on_disc`` determines the maximal amount of models used in the ensemble). If set to None, this feature is disabled.

Inspecting the results
======================

Auto-PyTorch allows users to inspect the training results and statistics. The following example shows how different statistics can be printed for the inspection.

>>> from autoPyTorch.api.tabular_classification import TabularClassificationTask
>>> automl = TabularClassificationTask()
>>> automl.fit(X_train, y_train)
>>> automl.show_models()
