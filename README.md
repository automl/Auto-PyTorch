# Auto-PyTorch

Copyright (C) 2019  [AutoML Group Freiburg](http://www.automl.org/)

This an alpha version of Auto-PyTorch with improved API.
So far, Auto-PyTorch supports tabular data (classification, regression).
We plan to enable image data and time-series data.


Find the documentation [here](https://automl.github.io/Auto-PyTorch/development)


## Installation

### Manual Installation

We recommend using Anaconda for developing as follows:

```sh
# Following commands assume the user is in a cloned directory of Auto-Pytorch

# We also need to initialize the automl_common repository as follows
# You can find more information about this here:
# https://github.com/automl/automl_common/
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Create the environment
conda create -n autopytorch python=3.8
conda activate autopytorch
For Linux:
    conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64 swig
For mac:
    conda install -c conda-forge clang_osx-64 clangxx_osx-64
    conda install -c anaconda swig
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
python setup.py install

```
